# myCodeSnippets
These are code snippets that I wrote for SSMS and visual studo. The SSMS ones are the most useful to me. There are only 2 for VS, one for tsql object documentation and a template tsqlt test. The SSMS ones consist of snippets to help write cursors, generate temp tables from an existing query/stored proc that returns a single record set. 

Pull requests are welcome. The deploy scripts are pretty fragile, I only update them as I need based off my SSMS/VS install paths and YMMV
